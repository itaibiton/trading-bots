## Strategy Templates Section

### Section Header
**Headline:** `Choose Your Strategy`
**Description:** `Pre-built trading strategies designed by professionals. Pick one and customize it to your needs, or let AI recommend the best fit.`

### Strategy 1: DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging)
**Icon:** 📊
**Full Name:** Dollar Cost Averaging
**Risk Level:** Low
**Complexity:** Beginner
**Timeframe:** Daily / Weekly
**Expected Return:** 8-15% annually
**Max Drawdown:** 10-15%
**Win Rate:** 60-65%

**Description:**
```
Automatically buy cryptocurrency at regular intervals regardless of price.
Reduces the impact of volatility by spreading purchases over time. Perfect
for long-term investors who want to build positions gradually.
```

**How It Works:**
```
Set your investment amount, frequency, and target asset. The bot automatically
purchases at your chosen intervals (daily, weekly, monthly), averaging your
entry price over time.
```

**Best For:**
- Beginners new to crypto trading
- Long-term investors (6+ months)
- Risk-averse traders
- Building a position over time

**Supported Pairs:**
BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, BNB/USDT, and 50+ more

---

### Strategy 2: Grid Trading
**Icon:** 🎯
**Full Name:** Grid Trading
**Risk Level:** Medium
**Complexity:** Intermediate
**Timeframe:** 1-4 hours
**Expected Return:** 15-25% annually
**Max Drawdown:** 15-25%
**Win Rate:** 65-70%

**Description:**
```
Place buy and sell orders at predetermined price intervals, creating a
"grid" of orders. Profits from market volatility by buying low and selling
high repeatedly within a price range.
```

**How It Works:**
```
Define your price range (upper and lower bounds) and number of grid levels.
The bot places buy orders below current price and sell orders above,
automatically executing trades as price moves through the grid.
```

**Best For:**
- Sideways/ranging markets
- Traders comfortable with volatility
- Those seeking consistent small profits
- Markets with predictable price ranges

**Supported Pairs:**
BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, Major altcoins with good liquidity

**Key Parameters:**
- Grid levels: 10-50
- Price range: ±10-30% from current price
- Investment per grid: $50-500

---

### Strategy 3: Momentum Trading
**Icon:** 🚀
**Full Name:** Momentum Trading
**Risk Level:** Medium-High
**Complexity:** Intermediate
**Timeframe:** 15min - 1 hour
**Expected Return:** 20-40% annually
**Max Drawdown:** 20-30%
**Win Rate:** 55-60%

**Description:**
```
Identify and ride strong price trends by analyzing volume, price action,
and technical indicators. Enters positions when momentum is confirmed and
exits when momentum weakens.
```

**How It Works:**
```
Bot monitors multiple technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Volume) to detect
strong trends. Enters trades when momentum is confirmed across indicators
and exits when momentum reverses or weakens.
```

**Best For:**
- Trending markets
- Active traders who can monitor positions
- Those comfortable with higher risk/reward
- Experienced traders understanding technical analysis

**Supported Pairs:**
High-volume pairs with strong trends (BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, SOL/USDT, etc.)

**Key Indicators:**
- RSI (Relative Strength Index)
- MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
- Volume analysis
- Moving averages (20/50/200 EMA)

---

### Strategy 4: Mean Reversion
**Icon:** 📈
**Full Name:** Mean Reversion
**Risk Level:** High
**Complexity:** Advanced
**Timeframe:** 1-4 hours
**Expected Return:** 25-50% annually
**Max Drawdown:** 25-35%
**Win Rate:** 60-65%

**Description:**
```
Exploits the tendency of prices to return to their average after extreme
movements. Buys oversold assets and sells overbought ones, profiting from
price corrections.
```

**How It Works:**
```
Bot calculates statistical average (mean) price over a period and identifies
when current price deviates significantly. Enters counter-trend positions
expecting price to revert to the mean.
```

**Best For:**
- Experienced traders
- Markets with established price ranges
- Those who understand statistical analysis
- Traders with strict risk management

**Supported Pairs:**
Liquid pairs with stable volatility patterns

**Key Concepts:**
- Bollinger Bands
- Standard deviation
- Overbought/oversold levels
- Statistical mean calculation

**Warning:**
```
Mean reversion works best in ranging markets. In strong trends, "buying the
dip" can lead to continued losses. Strict stop-losses are essential.
```

**AI:** 👋 Hi! What's your main trading goal?

**User:** Regular income

**AI:** Great! How would you describe your trading experience?

**User:** Intermediate - I've traded crypto before

**AI:** Excellent. For regular income with your experience, I'd suggest Grid Trading or Mean Reversion.

What type of market conditions do you prefer?
- Ranging/sideways markets
- Trending markets

**User:** Ranging markets

**AI:** Perfect! Grid Trading works best in ranging markets.

Risk tolerance?

**User:** Moderate

**AI:** ✅ Here's my recommendation:

**Strategy:** Grid Trading
**Capital:** $5,000
**Price Range:** ±15% from current BTC price
**Grid Levels:** 20
**Expected Weekly Income:** $50-150 (1-3% weekly)

This setup will place buy and sell orders across a 30% price range, profiting from Bitcoin's natural volatility.

## Risk Management Section

### Section Header
**Headline:** `Your Safety Is Our Priority`
**Description:** `Every bot comes with mandatory risk controls. We never let you deploy without proper safeguards.`

### Feature 1: Mandatory Stop-Loss
**Icon:** 🛡️
**Title:** `Automatic Stop-Loss`

**Description:**
```
Every bot requires a stop-loss setting before deployment. If your position
loses the specified percentage, the bot automatically closes it to prevent
further losses.
```

**How It Works:**
- Set maximum acceptable loss per trade (e.g., 5%)
- Bot monitors all positions in real-time
- Automatically exits when stop-loss is hit
- Prevents emotional decision-making

**Example:**
```
If you set a 10% stop-loss on a $1,000 position, the bot will automatically
sell if the value drops to $900, limiting your loss to $100.
```

---

### Feature 2: Position Size Limits
**Icon:** 📊
**Title:** `Position Size Controls`

**Description:**
```
Limit how much of your capital can be used in a single trade. This ensures
diversification and prevents over-concentration in one position.
```

**Default Settings:**
- Maximum 25% of capital per position
- Adjustable from 10-50%
- Recommended: 20% for beginners

**Why This Matters:**
```
Even if one trade goes wrong, you still have 75% of your capital protected
to trade another day.
```

---

### Feature 3: Paper Trading First
**Icon:** 🎯
**Title:** `Virtual Money Testing`

**Description:**
```
All new bots start in paper trading mode with $10,000 virtual balance. Test
your strategy risk-free before committing real money.
```

**Benefits:**
- See exactly how your bot performs
- Test different market conditions
- Refine settings without risk
- Build confidence before going live

**How Long:**
```
Test for as long as you want. Most users test for 1-2 weeks before switching
to live trading. There's no time limit or pressure.
```

---

### Feature 4: Daily Loss Caps
**Icon:** 🔒
**Title:** `Maximum Daily Loss Limits`

**Description:**
```
Set a maximum amount you're willing to lose in a single day. If reached, the
bot automatically pauses until the next day.
```

**Example:**
```
With a $100 daily loss cap, if your bot loses $100 in trades today, it will
pause all trading until tomorrow. This prevents bad days from spiraling into
disasters.
```

**Recommended Settings:**
- Beginners: 2-5% of capital per day
- Intermediate: 5-10% of capital per day
- Advanced: Custom settings

---

### Feature 5: Real-Time Monitoring
**Icon:** 👁️
**Title:** `24/7 Performance Tracking`

**Description:**
```
Monitor your bot's performance in real-time from anywhere. Set up alerts for
important events like large profits, losses, or errors.

## FAQ Section

### Section Header
**Headline:** `Frequently Asked Questions`
**Description:** `Everything you need to know about TradingBot.`

---

### Question 1: Is my money safe?
**Answer:**
```
Yes. We never hold or have access to your funds. You connect to exchanges
using API keys with trading-only permissions (no withdrawal rights). Your
capital stays in your exchange account at all times. We simply execute trades
on your behalf using your API keys.

Additionally, all data is encrypted, we're SOC 2 compliant, and we use
industry-standard security practices.
```

---

### Question 2: Do I need to code?
**Answer:**
```
No coding required. Our AI guides you through the entire process using simple
questions and plain English. You'll review everything in an easy-to-understand
dashboard before deployment.

If you want to customize advanced parameters later, you can, but it's entirely
optional.
```

---

### Question 3: What's paper trading?
**Answer:**
```
Paper trading (also called simulated trading) lets you test your bot with
virtual money before risking real capital. You start with $10,000 in virtual
balance, and the bot executes trades in real-time against real market prices
- but with fake money.

This lets you see exactly how your bot performs without any risk. When you're
confident, you can switch to live trading with one click.
```

---

### Question 4: Can I customize my trading strategy?
**Answer:**
```
Absolutely. After the AI creates your initial bot, you can adjust:
- Risk parameters (stop-loss, take-profit)
- Investment amounts
- Trading pairs
- Strategy type
- Position sizes
- Daily loss limits

Everything is adjustable through a simple dashboard interface.
```

---

### Question 5: Which exchanges do you support?
**Answer:**
```
Currently, we support Binance (largest crypto exchange globally). Support for
additional exchanges is coming soon:

Coming Q1 2025:
- Coinbase Pro
- Kraken
- Bybit

You can vote on which exchange you'd like to see next in your dashboard.
```

---

### Question 6: How much does it cost?
**Answer:**
```
TradingBot is free to start:

- Paper Trading: Free forever
- Live Trading: 2% of profitable trades (no subscription fees)
- No hidden fees or charges

You only pay when you make money. If your bot loses, you pay nothing. This
aligns our success with yours.

Example: If your bot makes $100 profit, we take $2. If it loses $50, you pay $0.
```

---

### Question 7: What if I want to stop my bot?
**Answer:**
```
You have full control:
- Pause your bot anytime (stops new trades, keeps open positions)
- Stop your bot completely (closes all positions, stops trading)
- Delete your bot permanently

All actions are instant. There are no lock-in periods or penalties for stopping.
```

---

### Question 8: How do I know if my bot is working?
**Answer:**
```
Your dashboard shows real-time performance:
- Current P&L (profit and loss)
- Total trades executed
- Win rate percentage
- Open positions
- Trade history
- Performance charts

You'll also receive email notifications for important events like:
- Profitable trades
- Stop-loss triggers
- Daily performance summaries
- Bot errors (rare)
```

---

### Question 9: What happens during extreme market volatility?
**Answer:**
```
Your bot has built-in protections:

1. Stop-Loss: Automatically exits losing positions at your preset limit
2. Daily Loss Cap: Pauses trading if daily losses hit your limit
3. Position Size Limits: Prevents over-concentration in one trade

Additionally, you can:
- Manually pause your bot during uncertain times
- Adjust risk parameters in real-time
- Close all positions with one click

Many users also set up alerts for unusual market activity.
```

---

### Question 10: Can I run multiple bots?
**Answer:**
```
Yes! You can run as many bots as you want:
- Test different strategies simultaneously
- Diversify across multiple trading pairs
- Run some in paper trading, others live
- Compare performance side-by-side

Each bot operates independently with its own capital allocation and risk settings.
