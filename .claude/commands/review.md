# Weekly Review & Sprint Planning

You are conducting a **comprehensive weekly review and planning session** for the TradingBot project.

## Instructions

**Use the PM subagent** to perform this work. The PM subagent has specialized tools and deep PM expertise for this task.

Execute the following command:

```
Use the pm subagent to conduct a weekly review and plan next week
```

## What the PM Subagent Will Do

The PM subagent will:

1. **Read ROADMAP.md and progress/tracking.md** thoroughly
2. **Analyze the week's accomplishments** (completed tasks with dates)
3. **Review in-progress tasks** and flag stale items (>3 days in progress)
4. **Calculate milestone progress** percentages and compare to targets
5. **Identify risks, blockers, and timeline concerns**
6. **Generate comprehensive review** with structured output
7. **Plan next week's goals** (3-5 realistic, prioritized tasks)
8. **Update progress/tracking.md** with review entry
9. **Make recommendations** for process improvements

## When to Use This Command

- **Weekly cadence:** Every Monday or at start of new week
- **Sprint transitions:** When moving between sprint/phase weeks
- **Before major decisions:** When strategic planning is needed
- **After milestones:** To assess progress and adjust course
- **When feeling stuck:** To regain clarity and direction

## Alternative Quick Options

If you just need a quick status check (not a full review), use:
```
/status
```

If you need task breakdown for a specific feature, ask:
```
Use the pm subagent to break down [feature name]
```

If you need sprint planning without the retrospective, ask:
```
Use the pm subagent to plan next week
```
